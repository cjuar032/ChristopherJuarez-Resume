          My name is Christopher Juarez and I am a first year college student attending the University of California Riverside. I am planning to major in business and concentrate on business management. Throughout my work and volunteer experience, I was able to learn and develop new skills to help pursue my future endeavours. Previously, I volunteered at an organization known as Hathaway Sycamores Leadership Program which consisted of high schoolers around the NorthEast Los Angeles area who would help support the community. Some things that we would do include participating in events such as Lummis Day. In these events, we would help set up tables, interview citizens gathering input on their opinions with these events, and attend meetings bi-weekly to plan future community events. Hathaway was a great experience for me because it was my first ever program that I joined and the first time I communicated with people with a bigger purpose in mind. The bigger purpose was to advocate the importance of young kids to give back to their communities and learn to communicate effectively with anyone. Being in the leadership program taught me how to talk confidently and to be more aware of what is going on in my community.  <br><br>

        Currently, I work at a restaurant called La Grande Orange Cafe and I am mainly positioned as a porter. I also work as a utility or a barback in case the restaurant needs it. When it comes to my job, I am assigned to various tasks such as preparing cordials for the bartenders, bussing and cleaning tables, and stocking fruits and beverages. From a business perspective, my job gives me great insight on the business side of a restaurant. I interact with the operations manager of my restaurant and communicate with him on the beverages and fruits the restaurant  needs to function for the following day. One of the main managers, usually communicates with the head manager prior to opening the restaurant talking about how sales either increase or decrease. For example, the restaurant saw an increase in sales when the signature cocktail Jumpin Jack Flash was back on the Menu after being shut off due to maintenance issues with the recipe. Another example where sales looked bad was when there was a day that not alot of people came to the restaurant on a Sunday morning. <br><br>

        Furthermore, my insight on both being an observant and a leader has allowed me to get a clear view in what it takes to be an effective business man in the future dealing with my own obstacles and overcoming them with my confidence.
